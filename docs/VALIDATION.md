# Validation

This page records what the current revision (branch `stability-hardening`, the
Azure DevOps REST revision) was tested with. Host integration, provider
admission, source fidelity, model quality and publication are separate claims; a
passing fixture establishes only the first. Earlier revisions and their live
acceptance runs, including the MCP-based runs, are preserved in
[validation history](VALIDATION_HISTORY.md).

## Environment

Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (WSL2, kernel 6.18), Node 22.23.3, OpenCode CLI 2.0.22,
Azure DevOps Services REST api-version 7.1. Date: 2026-10-10.

## Offline tests

`npm run check` and `npm test` pass: 227 tests across settings (including the
`mcp` → `azure` migration), host helpers, session transport, the shared queue,
the REST client (change paging, merge base, error classes, retries, timeouts
that abort requests, binary and oversized files, the per-run cache, PAT never
logged), the reviewers' tools, output acceptance and correction prompts, comment
validation and markers, planning and publication, review sharding, persistence,
rendering, installation and the runtime integration (fake host plus a fake Azure
DevOps REST service).

## REST API version check

Read-only requests against a live Azure DevOps Services organization: every
resource AZPR uses reports a minimum version of 1.0 or 3.0, a released version
of 7.1 and a maximum of 7.2. The PR, iterations, iteration changes, threads,
item (raw and JSON) and folder requests returned identical fields on 5.0, 5.1,
6.0, 7.0, 7.1 and 7.2-preview. An invalid PAT or a missing credential returns
HTTP 203 with an HTML sign-in page, an out-of-range version returns 400
`VssVersionOutOfRangeException`, and a missing PR returns 404 `TF401180`. Thread
creation with 7.1 was exercised in the live run below.

## Exact-host fixtures

`tests/host-v2-smoke.mjs` (fresh install and `--replace`) runs the real OpenCode
2.0.22 binary with a loopback fake model provider, a loopback fake Azure DevOps
REST service and one foreign stdio MCP server. Both passed:

| Scenario | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| `/pr-check` | READY with zero model requests; REST reads only. |
| `/pr-review` | COMPLETE; reviewers read HEAD through `azpr_read_file`; `shell`, `execute` and the foreign MCP tool were absent from every private model request; the verifier was corrected by one repair turn in the same session; the runtime read the change list and rechecked versions; PROGRESS notices reached the conversation; the review was persisted. |
| `/pr-comment` | PREVIEW, then `--publish` POSTED one summary and one inline comment with markers and file context. |
| Restart | After restarting the host, `/pr-comment --publish` returned POSTED with ALREADY_PRESENT, no new writes and no model request. |
| Tool scopes | An ordinary conversation's model request carried the foreign MCP tool and no `azpr_*` tool. |
| `/pr-stop` | A review hanging at the provider was CANCELLED. |
| Private sessions | Generate and compaction on a private session sent no provider request; ordinary generation still worked. |
| TUI | New and existing TUI sessions kept their origin and cancelled from the same TUI. |

The first smoke attempt failed: AZPR's tools were registered without
`codemode: false`, so OpenCode placed them behind CodeMode `execute`, which
private reviewers may not use, and reviewers saw no AZPR tool. The tools are now
registered with `codemode: false`, and the test tool registry applies the same
rule so the offline runtime tests catch a regression.

`tests/host-v2-comment-scale.mjs` passed on the same host:

| Property | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Changed files | 120, reviewed in 5 shards of 24 per role |
| Context overflow | One functional shard reported a nearly full context; the host attempted compaction, AZPR refused it, and the shard was split into `1/5a` and `1/5b`, both COMPLETE |
| Verification | 30 findings in 2 verification sessions |
| Planning | 8 pages of at most four findings |
| Publication | 21 threads (20 inline, 1 summary; 10 low findings in the summary); a second publish wrote nothing |
| Largest provider request | 27,185 characters |
| REST calls | 71 |

## Live run (Azure DevOps Services, real model)

PR kevin888y/OpenCode #2 (one changed file), `openai/gpt-5.6-luna` for all three
roles, `zh-TW`, through the user's OpenCode service with the installed package,
`azure.organization` and an existing PAT in AZPR's settings. The AZPR comments
of earlier runs were deleted first.

| Step | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `/pr-check` | READY, 5 s; 6 REST calls; head, merge base, 1 changed file, HEAD and BASE reads, 156 threads. |
| `/pr-review` | COMPLETE, 75 s; three medium findings confirmed; reviewers made 20 tool calls (file reads and root listings at exact commits) served by 9 REST requests thanks to the run cache; no correction turn, retry or tool error. |
| `/pr-comment --publish` | POSTED 4 items (summary and three inline), 25 s; planning took 1 model request and no tools. |
| Second publish | POSTED, all 4 ALREADY_PRESENT, no write. |

Independent REST read-back found the inline threads on `/fulfillment.py` at
right-side lines 19–24, 29 and 37, each with its marker; Azure DevOps attached
`pullRequestThreadContext` (iteration 1/1, change tracking ID 1) itself. The
four private sessions used about 54,500 input tokens (the two MCP-based runs used
about 241,000 and 80,000). All 34 REST calls of the four commands succeeded on
the first attempt. The test comments were deleted after the read-back.

`/pr-check` of PR #3 (316 changed files) returned READY with all 316 files as a
complete list and the merge base; through MCP 2.9.0 the runtime saw 100.

## Not yet validated

- A full real-model review of a large PR (for example PR #3): sharding, overflow
  splits and verifier sharding on real data.
- A PAT limited to Code (Read) and Pull Request Threads (Read & write); the live
  run used an existing PAT whose scopes were not inspected.
- Azure DevOps Server, and repository files that are not UTF-8 text.
- Rendered comments and anchors in the Azure DevOps UI were not inspected.
